Learning Styles Survey
Overview
The Learning Styles Survey is a web-based tool designed to help students, teachers, and administrators identify their preferred learning styles. Based on the VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic), the survey presents 25 carefully crafted questions to assess how individuals best process and retain information. The results are displayed as percentages, showing the relative preference for each learning style.

This survey can be used to:

Understand personal learning preferences.
Assist educators in tailoring their teaching strategies.
Help administrators make data-driven decisions for effective learning environments
